SMS Spam Detection

Overview

This project is focused on building a model for SMS spam detection. The primary goal is to classify SMS messages as either 'spam' or 'ham' (non-spam) using machine learning techniques. The implementation is designed for easy experimentation and understanding, making use of Jupyter Notebook and Python programming.

Features

Dataset Preprocessing: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization techniques like Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF.

Model Training: Several machine learning algorithms are employed, including:

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Random Forests

Evaluation: The project evaluates models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Interactive Notebook: Implementation is provided in an easy-to-use Google Colab notebook for experimentation.

Installation

To run this project locally or in Google Colab, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Steps to Set Up

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detection.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd sms-spam-detection

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook

Usage

Load the dataset: The project includes sample SMS data for training and testing.

Preprocess the data: Run the cells for text cleaning and vectorization.

Train models: Choose from the available algorithms to train your spam detection model.

Evaluate models: Analyze performance metrics to determine the best model.

Experiment: Modify hyperparameters or add new algorithms for further exploration.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains labeled SMS messages, with 'spam' and 'ham' as the categories. If you want to use a custom dataset, ensure it has a similar structure with labels and message content.
